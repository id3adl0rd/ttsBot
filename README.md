## ttsBot - Text-to-Speech Discord Bot

#ttsBot is a unique Discord bot developed in Golang, designed to enhance the communication experience for users with disabilities. This botâ€™s primary function is to convert any text message into a voice message, allowing users to engage in conversations effortlessly.
